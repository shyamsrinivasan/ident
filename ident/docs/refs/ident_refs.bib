  abstract  = {Kinetic models are crucial to quantitatively understand and predict how functional behavior emerges from dynamic concentration changes of cellular components. The current challenge is on resolving uncertainties about parameter values of reaction kinetics. Additionally, there are also major structural uncertainties due to unknown molecular interactions and only putatively assigned regulatory functions. What if one or few key regulators of biochemical reactions are missing in a metabolic model? By reviewing current advances in building kinetic models of metabolism, we found that such models experience a paradigm shift away from fitting parameters towards identifying key regulatory interactions. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {An overview is presented of the different approximative enzyme kinetic formats that have been proposed for use in metabolic modeling studies. It is considered that the following four general properties are relevant for approximative kinetics: the rate must be proportional to enzyme level; at high metabolite concentrations, there is downward concave behavior of rate versus concentration; the number of kinetic parameters should be as small as possible; analytical solutions of steady-state network balances are desirable. Six different approximative kinetic formats are evaluated (linear, logarithmic-linear, power law GMA, power law S-systems, thermokinetic, linear-logarithmic) and it is concluded that only the recently proposed linear-logarithmic approach combines all desired properties and therefore seems a most appropriate approximate kinetic format.},

  abstract = {Constraint-based modeling of biological networks (metabolism, transcription and signal transduction), although used successfully in many applications, suffer from specific limitations such as the lack of representation of metabolite concentrations and enzymatic regulation, which are necessary for a complete physiologically relevant model. Kinetic models conversely overcome these shortcomings and enable dynamic analysis of biological systems for enhanced in silico hypothesis generation. Nonetheless, kinetic models also have limitations for modeling at genome-scales chiefly due to: (i) model non-linearity; (ii) computational tractability; (iii) parameter identifiability; (iv) estimability; and (v) uncertainty. In order to support further development of kinetic models as viable alternatives to constraint-based models, this review presents a brief description of the existing obstacles towards building genome-scale kinetic models. Specific kinetic modeling frameworks capable of overcoming these obstacles are covered in this review. The tractability and physiological feasibility of these models are discussed with the objective of using available in vivo experimental observations to define the model parameter space. Among the different methods discussed, Monte Carlo kinetic models of metabolism stand out as potentially tractable methods to model genome scale networks while also addressing in vivo parameter uncertainty.},

  abstract  = {Complete modeling of metabolic networks is desirable, but it is difficult to accomplish because of the lack of kinetics. As a step toward this goal, we have developed an approach to build an ensemble of dynamic models that reach the same steady state. The models in the ensemble are based on the same mechanistic framework at the elementary reaction level, including known regulations, and span the space of all kinetics allowable by thermodynamics. This ensemble allows for the examination of possible phenotypes of the network upon perturbations, such as changes in enzyme expression levels. The size of the ensemble is reduced by acquiring data for such perturbation phenotypes. If the mechanistic framework is approximately accurate, the ensemble converges to a smaller set of models and becomes more predictive. This approach bypasses the need for detailed characterization of kinetic parameters and arrives at a set of models that describes relevant phenotypes upon enzyme perturbations.},

  abstract  = {— Understanding the metabolic function of microorganisms has recently received a lot of attention due to its importance in fields such as health and industry. Metabolism in microorganisms is a sophisticated process comprised of several thousands of different components with intricate interactions between them. This characteristic is translated into complex dynamical behavior that such systems can exhibit e.g., multiple steady states, hysteresis, or oscillations. Kinetic models of the processes occurring in the cells allow us not just to determine optimal conditions for a given objective but also to assess their stability properties. In this work we evaluate the stability of the central carbon metabolism of E. coli, using the Chassagnole et al. model, at optimal enzyme levels as determined by [1] for the production of serine. To accomplish this, we construct bifurcation diagrams considering the level of one, two and three enzymes as bifurcation parameters. We determine that the system goes through a Hopf bifurcation and/or a limit point for certain parameter values. This is achieved for a 68{\%} change in the enzyme level, implying that the system is robust to perturbations on the process parameters at the optimal enzyme levels for the employed model description.},

  abstract = {Mathematical modeling is an essential tool for a comprehensive understanding of cell metabolism and its interactions with the environmental and process conditions. Recent developments in the construction and analysis of stoichiometric models made it possible to define limits on steady-state metabolic behavior using flux balance analysis. However, detailed information about enzyme kinetics and enzyme regulation is needed to formulate kinetic models that can accurately capture the dynamic metabolic responses. The use of mechanistic enzyme kinetics is a difficult task due to uncertainty in the kinetic properties of enzymes. Therefore, the majority of recent works consider only the mass action kinetics for the reactions in the metabolic networks. In this work, we applied the ORACLE framework and constructed a large-scale, mechanistic kinetic model of optimally grown E. coli. We investigated the complex interplay between stoichiometry, thermodynamics, and kinetics in determining the flexibility and capabilities of metabolism. Our results indicate that enzyme saturation is a necessary consideration in modeling metabolic networks and it extends the feasible ranges of the metabolic fluxes and metabolite concentrations. Our results further suggest that the enzymes in metabolic networks have evolved to function at different saturation states to ensure greater flexibility and robustness of the cellular metabolism.},

  abstract  = {Rational metabolic engineering methods are increasingly employed in designing the commercially viable processes for the production of chemicals relevant to pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and food and beverage industries. With the growing availability of omics data and of methodologies capable to integrate the available data into models, mathematical modeling and computational analysis are becoming important in designing recombinant cellular organisms and optimizing cell performance with respect to desired criteria. In this contribution, we used the computational framework ORACLE (Optimization and Risk Analysis of Complex Living Entities) to analyze the physiology of recombinant Escherichia coli producing 1,4-butanediol (BDO) and to identify potential strategies for improved production of BDO. The framework allowed us to integrate data across multiple levels and to construct a population of large-scale kinetic models despite the lack of available information about kinetic properties of every enzyme in the metabolic pathways. We analyzed these models and we found that the enzymes that primarily control the fluxes leading to BDO production are part of central glycolysis, the lower branch of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the novel BDO production route. Interestingly, among the enzymes between the glucose uptake and the BDO pathway, the enzymes belonging to the lower branch of TCA cycle have been identified as the most important for improving BDO production and yield. We also quantified the effects of changes of the target enzymes on other intracellular states like energy charge, cofactor levels, redox state, cellular growth, and byproduct formation. Independent earlier experiments on this strain confirmed that the computationally obtained conclusions are consistent with the experimentally tested designs, and the findings of the present studies can provide guidance for future work on strain improvement. Overall, these studies demonstrate the potential and effectiveness of ORACLE for the accelerated design of microbial cell factories.},

In this contribution we show how global identifiability for an arbitrary model structure (basically with analytic non-linearities) can be analyzed using concepts and algorithms from differential algebra. It is shown how the question of global structural identifiability is reduced to the question of whether the given model structure can be rearranged as a linear regression. An explicit algorithm to test this is also given. Furthermore, the question of ‘persistent excitation' for the input can also be tested explicitly is a similar fashion. The algorithms involved are very well suited for implementation in computer algebra. One such implementation is also described.},

  abstract  = {A priori global identifiability is a structural property of biological and physiological models. It is considered a prerequisite for well-posed estimation, since it concerns the possibility of recovering uniquely the unknown model parameters from measured input-output data, under ideal conditions (noise-free observations and error-free model structure). Of course, determining if the parameters can be uniquely recovered from observed data is essential before investing resources, time and effort in performing actual biomedical experiments. Many interesting biological models are nonlinear but identifiability analysis for nonlinear system turns out to be a difficult mathematical problem. Different methods have been proposed in the literature to test identifiability of nonlinear models but, to the best of our knowledge, so far no software tools have been proposed for automatically checking identifiability of nonlinear models. In this paper, we describe a software tool implementing a differential algebra algorithm to perform parameter identifiability analysis for (linear and) nonlinear dynamic models described by polynomial or rational equations. Our goal is to provide the biological investigator a completely automatized software, requiring minimum prior knowledge of mathematical modelling and no in-depth understanding of the mathematical tools. The DAISY (Differential Algebra for Identifiability of SYstems) software will potentially be useful in biological modelling studies, especially in physiology and clinical medicine, where research experiments are particularly expensive and/or difficult to perform.

It can be derived from a simple random-order enzyme mechanism. Thermodynamic laws can impose dependencies on the kinetic parameters. Hence, to facilitate model fitting and parameter optimisation for large networks, we introduce thermodynamically independent system parameters: their values can be varied independently, without violating thermodynamical constraints. We achieve this by expressing the equilibrium constants either by Gibbs free energies of formation or by a set of independent equilibrium constants. The remaining system parameters are mean turnover rates, generalised Michaelis-Menten constants, and constants for inhibition and activation. All parameters correspond to molecular energies, for instance, binding energies between reactants and enzyme. CONCLUSION: Convenience kinetics can be used to translate a biochemical network--manually or automatically--into a dynamical model with plausible biological properties. It implements enzyme saturation and regulation by activators and inhibitors, covers all possible reaction stoichiometries, and can be specified by a small number of parameters. Its mathematical form makes it especially suitable for parameter estimation and optimisation. Parameter estimates can be easily computed from a least-squares fit to Michaelis-Menten values, turnover rates, equilibrium constants, and other quantities that are routinely measured in enzyme assays and stored in kinetic databases.},

  abstract  = {Accurate determination of physiological states of cellular metabolism requires detailed information about metabolic fluxes, metabolite concentrations and distribution of enzyme states. Integration of fluxomics and metabolomics data, and thermodynamics-based metabolic flux analysis contribute to improved understanding of steady-state properties of metabolism. However, knowledge about kinetics and enzyme activities though essential for quantitative understanding of metabolic dynamics remains scarce and involves uncertainty. Here, we present a computational methodology that allow us to determine and quantify the kinetic parameters that correspond to a certain physiology as it is described by a given metabolic flux profile and a given metabolite concentration vector. Though we initially determine kinetic parameters that involve a high degree of uncertainty, through the use of kinetic modeling and machine learning principles we are able to obtain more accurate ranges of kinetic parameters, and hence we are able to reduce the uncertainty in the model analysis. We computed the distribution of kinetic parameters for glucose-fed E. coli producing 1,4-butanediol and we discovered that the observed physiological state corresponds to a narrow range of kinetic parameters of only a few enzymes, whereas the kinetic parameters of other enzymes can vary widely. Furthermore, this analysis suggests which are the enzymes that should be manipulated in order to engineer the reference state of the cell in a desired way. The proposed approach also sets up the foundations of a novel type of approaches for efficient, non-asymptotic, uniform sampling of solution spaces.},

We here present tissue-specific constraint-based core models for three different types of tumors (liver, breast and lung) that serve this purpose. The core models were extracted and manually curated from the corresponding genome-scale metabolic models in the Human Metabolic Atlas database with a focus on the pathways that are known to play a key role in cancer growth and proliferation. Along similar lines, we also reconstructed a core model from the original general human metabolic network to be used as a reference model. A comparative Flux Balance Analysis between the reference and the cancer models highlighted both a clear distinction between the two conditions and a heterogeneity within the three different cancer types in terms of metabolic flux distribution. These results emphasize the need for modeling approaches able to keep up with this tumoral heterogeneity in order to identify more suitable drug targets and develop effective treatments. According to this perspective, we identified key points able to reverse the tumoral phenotype toward the reference one or vice-versa.},

Although metabolism continuously adapts to unpredictable environmental changes, and although bistability was found in certain substrate-uptake pathways, central carbon metabolism is thought to operate deterministically. Here, we combine experiment and theory to demonstrate that a clonal Escherichia coli population splits into two stochastically generated phenotypic subpopulations after glucose-gluconeogenic substrate shifts. Most cells refrain from growth, entering a dormant persister state that manifests as a lag phase in the population growth curve. The subpopulation-generating mechanism resides at the metabolic core, overarches the metabolic and transcriptional networks, and only allows the growth of cells initially achieving sufficiently high gluconeogenic flux. Thus, central metabolism does not ensure the gluconeogenic growth of individual cells, but uses a population-level adaptation resulting in responsive diversification upon nutrient changes.},

Despite a thorough knowledge base of Escherichia coli's central metabolism and its regulation, fundamental aspects of the employed sensing and regulatory adjustment mechanisms remain unclear. In this paper, using a differential equation model that couples enzymatic and transcriptional regulation of E. coli's central metabolism, we show that the interplay of known interactions explains in molecular-level detail the system-wide adjustments of metabolic operation between glycolytic and gluconeogenic carbon sources. We show that these adaptations are enabled by an indirect recognition of carbon sources through a mechanism we termed distributed sensing of intracellular metabolic fluxes. This mechanism uses two general motifs to establish flux-signaling metabolites, whose bindings to transcription factors form flux sensors. As these sensors are embedded in global feedback loop architectures, closed-loop self-regulation can emerge within metabolism itself and therefore, metabolic operation may adapt itself autonomously (not requiring upstream sensing and signaling) to fluctuating carbon sources.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Standard rate laws are a key requisite for systematically turning metabolic networks into kinetic models. They should provide simple, general and biochemically plausible formulae for reaction velocities and reaction elasticities. At the same time, they need to respect thermodynamic relations between the kinetic constants and the metabolic fluxes and concentrations. RESULTS: We present a family of reversible rate laws for reactions with arbitrary stoichiometries and various types of regulation, including mass-action, Michaelis-Menten and uni-uni reversible Hill kinetics as special cases. With a thermodynamically safe parameterization of these rate laws, parameter sets obtained by model fitting, sampling or optimization are guaranteed to lead to consistent chemical equilibrium states. A reformulation using saturation values yields simple formulae for rates and elasticities, which can be easily adjusted to the given stationary flux distributions. Furthermore, this formulation highlights the role of chemical potential differences as thermodynamic driving forces. We compare the modular rate laws to the thermodynamic-kinetic modelling formalism and discuss a simplified rate law in which the reaction rate directly depends on the reaction affinity. For automatic handling of modular rate laws, we propose a standard syntax and semantic annotations for the Systems Biology Markup Language.

This framework readily supports advanced modelling features such as model selection and model-based experimental design. We illustrate this approach on the tightly-regulated mammalian methionine cycle. Sampling from the posterior distribution, the proposed framework generated thermodynamically feasible parameter samples that converged on the true values, and displayed remarkable prediction accuracy in several validation tests. Furthermore, a posteriori analysis of the parameter distributions enabled appraisal of the systems properties of the network (e.g., control structure) and key metabolic regulations. Finally, the framework was used to predict missing allosteric interactions.},

We argue here that understanding and engineering microbial communities requires a holistic view that considers not only species–species, but also species–environment interactions, and feedbacks between ecological and evolutionary dynamics (eco-evo feedbacks). Due this multi-level nature of interactions, we predict that approaches aimed soley at altering specific species populations in a community (through strain enrichment or inhibition), would only have a transient impact, and species–environment and eco-evo feedbacks would eventually drive the microbial community to its original state. We propose a higher-level engineering approach that is based on thermodynamics of microbial growth, and that considers specifically microbial redox biochemistry. Within this approach, the emphasis is on enforcing specific environmental conditions onto the community. These are expected to generate higher-level thermodynamic bounds onto the system, which the community structure and function can then adapt to. We believe that the resulting end-state can be ecologically and evolutionarily stable, mimicking the natural states of complex communities. Toward designing the exact nature of the environmental enforcement, thermodynamics and redox biochemistry can act as coarse-grained principles, while the use of electrodes—as electron providing or accepting redox agents—can provide implementation with spatiotemporal control.},

Here, we develop a systems approach to integrate time-course metabolomics data with a computational model of metabolism to analyze the metabolic state of naive and primed murine pluripotent stem cells. Using this approach, we find that one-carbon metabolism involving phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, folate synthesis, and nucleotide synthesis is a key pathway that differs between the two states, resulting in differential sensitivity to anti-folates. The model also predicts that the pluripotency factor Lin28 regulates this one-carbon metabolic pathway, which we validate using metabolomics data from Lin28-deficient cells. Moreover, we identify and validate metabolic reactions related to S-adenosyl-methionine production that can differentially impact histone methylation in naive and primed cells. Our network-based approach provides a framework for characterizing metabolic changes influencing pluripotency and cell fate.},

  abstract  = {We found that the cancerous pancreas harbors a markedly more abundant microbiome compared with normal pancreas in both mice and humans, and select bacteria are differentially increased in the tumorous pancreas compared with gut. Ablation of the microbiome protects against preinvasive and invasive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), whereas transfer of bacteria from PDA-bearing hosts, but not controls, reverses tumor protection. Bacterial ablation was associated with immunogenic reprogramming of the PDA tumor microenvironment, including a reduction in myeloid-derived suppressor cells and an increase in M1 macrophage differentiation, promoting TH1 differentiation of CD4+T cells and CD8+T-cell activation. Bacterial ablation also enabled efficacy for checkpoint-targeted immunotherapy by upregulating PD-1 expression. Mechanistically, the PDA microbiome generated a tolerogenic immune program by differentially activating select Toll-like receptors in monocytic cells. These data suggest that endogenous microbiota promote the crippling immune-suppression characteristic of PDA and that the microbiome has potential as a therapeutic target in the modulation of disease progression.Significance:We found that a distinct and abundant microbiome drives suppressive monocytic cellular differentiation in pancreatic cancer via selective Toll-like receptor ligation leading to T-cell anergy.

  abstract = {Background: The optimization of metabolic rates (as linear objective functions) represents the methodical core of flux-balance analysis techniques which have become a standard tool for the study of genome-scale metabolic models. Besides (growth and synthesis) rates, metabolic yields are key parameters for the characterization of biochemical transformation processes, especially in the context of biotechnological applications. However, yields are ratios of rates, and hence the optimization of yields (as nonlinear objective functions) under arbitrary linear constraints is not possible with current flux-balance analysis techniques. Despite the fundamental importance of yields in constraint-based modeling, a comprehensive mathematical framework for yield optimization is still missing. Results: We present a mathematical theory that allows to systematically compute and analyze yield-optimal solutions of metabolic models under arbitrary linear constraints. In particular, we formulate yield optimization as a linear-fractional program. For practical computations, we transform the linear-fractional yield optimization problem to a (higher-dimensional) linear problem. Its solutions determine the solutions of the original problem and can be used to predict yield-optimal flux distributions in genome-scale metabolic models. For the theoretical analysis, we consider the linear-fractional problem directly. Most importantly, we show that the yield-optimal solution set (like the rate-optimal solution set) is determined by (yield-optimal) elementary flux vectors of the underlying metabolic model. However, yield- and rate-optimal solutions may differ from each other, and hence optimal (biomass or product) yields are not necessarily obtained at solutions with optimal (growth or synthesis) rates. Moreover, we discuss phase planes/production envelopes and yield spaces, in particular, we prove that yield spaces are convex and provide algorithms for their computation. We illustrate our findings by a small example and demonstrate their relevance for metabolic engineering with realistic models of E. coli. Conclusions: We develop a comprehensive mathematical framework for yield optimization in metabolic models. Our theory is particularly useful for the study and rational modification of cell factories designed under given yield and/or rate requirements.},

The estimation of kinetic parameters in vivo is a challenge due to the complexity of the internal cell environment. This concise review analyzes the limitations of in vitro and in vivo approaches and shows that not all parameters can be determined and that multicollinearity exists. On the other hand, this review also shows that cell metabolism is adequately described with a smaller number of parameters and with approximative or reduced models. A major hurdle is the identification and quantification of allosteric effectors. Despite limitations, in vivo kinetic experiments are adequate in providing a quantitative description of the cell as a system.},

  abstract = {Two divergent modelling methodologies have been adopted to increase our understanding of metabolism and its regulation. Constraint-based modelling highlights the optimal path through a stoichiometric network within certain physicochemical constraints. Such an approach requires minimal biological data to make quantitative inferences about network behaviour; however, constraint-based modelling is unable to give an insight into cellular substrate concentrations. In contrast, kinetic modelling aims to characterize fully the mechanics of each enzymatic reaction. This approach suffers because parameterizing mechanistic models is both costly and time-consuming. In this paper, we outline a method for developing a kinetic model for a metabolic network, based solely on the knowledge of reaction stoichiometries. Fluxes through the system, estimated by flux balance analysis, are allowed to vary dynamically according to linlog kinetics. Elasticities are estimated from stoichiometric considerations. When compared to a popular branched model of yeast glycolysis, we observe an excellent agreement between the real and approximate models, despite the absence of (and indeed the requirement for) experimental data for kinetic constants. Moreover, using this particular methodology affords us analytical forms for steady state determination, stability analyses and studies of dynamical behaviour.},

Unknowns in the metabolic flux behavior arise from kinetic interactions, especially allosteric control mechanisms. While the stoichiometry of enzymes is preserved in vitro, their activity and kinetic behavior differs from the in vivo situation. Next to this challenge, it is infeasible to test the interaction of each enzyme with each intracellular metabolite in vitro exhaustively. As a consequence, the whole interacting metabolome has to be studied in vivo to identify the relevant enzymes properties. In this review we discuss current approaches for in vivo perturbation experiments, that is, stimulus response experiments using different setups and quantitative analytical approaches, including dynamic carbon tracing.

  abstract = {Metabolic pathways in cells must be sufficiently robust to tolerate fluctuations in expression levels and changes in environmental conditions. Perturbations in expression levels may lead to system failure due to the disappearance of a stable steady state. Increasing evidence has suggested that biological networks have evolved such that they are intrinsically robust in their network structure. In this article, we presented Ensemble Modeling for Robustness Analysis (EMRA), which combines a continuation method with the Ensemble Modeling approach, for investigating the robustness issue of non-native pathways. EMRA investigates a large ensemble of reference models with different parameters, and determines the effects of parameter drifting until a bifurcation point, beyond which a stable steady state disappears and system failure occurs. A pathway is considered to have high bifurcational robustness if the probability of system failure is low in the ensemble. To demonstrate the utility of EMRA, we investigate the bifurcational robustness of two synthetic central metabolic pathways that achieve carbon conservation: non-oxidative glycolysis and reverse glyoxylate cycle. With EMRA, we determined the probability of system failure of each design and demonstrated that alternative designs of these pathways indeed display varying degrees of bifurcational robustness. Furthermore, we demonstrated that target selection for flux improvement should consider the trade-offs between robustness and performance.},

As the complexity required to describe different system increases, so does the need for determining how well such predictions can be made.

The method uses the information obtained from short term chemostat perturbation experiments. We approximate the time constant of each metabolite pool by their turn-over time and classify the pools accordingly into two groups: fast and slow pools. We performed a priori model reduction, neglecting the dynamic term of the fast pools. By making use of the linlog approximative kinetics, we obtained a general explicit solution for the fast pools in terms of the slow pools by elaborating the degenerate algebraic system resulting from model reduction. The obtained relations yielded also analytical relations between a subset of kinetic parameters. These relations also allow to realize an analytical model reduction using lumped reaction kinetics. After solving these theoretical identifiability problems and performing model reduction, we carried out a Monte Carlo approach to study the practical identifiability problems. We illustrated the methodology on model reduction and theoretical/practical identifiability analysis on an example system representing the glycolysis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells.},

The full system information is used for estimation of the model parameters. An optimal experiment design using the parameter identifiability and D-optimality criteria is formulated to provide "rich" experimental data for maximizing the accuracy of the parameter estimates in subsequent iterations. The importance of model identifiability tests for optimal measurement selection is also considered. The iterative scheme is tested on a model for the caspase function in apoptosis where it is demonstrated that model accuracy improves with each iteration. Optimal experiment design was determined to be critical for model identification.

Thus, traditional (gradient-based) local optimization methods fail to arrive at satisfactory solutions. To surmount this limitation, the use of several state-of-the-art deterministic and stochastic global optimization methods is explored. A case study considering the estimation of 36 parameters of a nonlinear biochemical dynamic model is taken as a benchmark. Only a certain type of stochastic algorithm, evolution strategies (ES), is able to solve this problem successfully. Although these stochastic methods cannot guarantee global optimality with certainty, their robustness, plus the fact that in inverse problems they have a known lower bound for the cost function, make them the best available candidates.},
